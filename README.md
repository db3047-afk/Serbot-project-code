# Serbot-project-code
🤖 ESP32 Line Follower + Obstacle Avoider Robot

This project combines line-following and obstacle-avoidance functionalities into a single autonomous robot powered by the ESP32 microcontroller.
It uses IR sensors for line tracking and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, while the TB6612FNG motor driver controls the movement of two DC motors.

🚀 Features

Dual Functionality: Follows a black/white line and avoids obstacles automatically.

Autonomous Navigation: Makes real-time decisions based on sensor input.

Smart Obstacle Detection: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect and bypass objects.

Smooth Motor Control: Controlled using TB6612FNG motor driver with PWM signals.

Fully Compatible: Works on the ESP32 development board.
